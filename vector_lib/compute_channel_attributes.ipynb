    "# Curvature Calculation for Digital Curves\n",
    "\n",
    "The curvature of a curve at any given point measures how quickly the curve deviates from a straight trajectory, which can be thought of as how \"curved\" the curve is at that point. For digital curves, which consist of discrete points rather than a continuous function, we need to adapt traditional curvature calculation methods to fit this discrete nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The method used here approximates curvature by measuring the angular change between consecutive segments along the curve. Each segment is defined by three consecutive points, and the curvature is estimated based on the angle formed at the middle point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps of Curvature Calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vector Calculation**:\n",
    "   For three consecutive points $p_1, p_2, p_3$, compute two vectors:\n",
    "   - $\\vec{v1} = p_2 - p_1$\n",
    "   - $\\vec{v2} = p_3 - p_2$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Angle Between Vectors**:\n",
    "   The angle $\\theta$ between $\\vec{v1}$ and $\\vec{v2}$ is calculated using the dot product formula:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\vec{v1} \\cdot \\vec{v2}}{\\|\\vec{v1}\\| \\|\\vec{v2}\\|}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   And then,\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\theta = \\arccos(\\cos(\\theta))\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   where $\\arccos$ is the arc cosine function, which returns the angle in radians for a given cosine value.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Curvature Estimation**:\n",
    "   The curvature $\\kappa$ at $p_2$ is then estimated as:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\kappa = \\frac{\\theta}{\\|\\vec{v1} + \\vec{v2}\\|}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   This represents the angular change per unit length, approximating the curvature at $p_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Maximum Curvature**:\n",
    "   The function iterates over all possible consecutive point triplets in the line and calculates the curvature for each. It then returns the maximum of these curvature values as the overall curvature of the curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `calculate_curvature(line)` can be called with a `LineString` object containing the coordinates of the curve points. It returns the maximum curvature found among all evaluated points, which identifies the point of highest curvature along the digital curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is particularly useful for digital geometry applications where curves are represented as sequences of discrete points rather than continuous functions.\n",
    "\n",
